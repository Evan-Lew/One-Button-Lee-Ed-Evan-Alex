<h1>Newton's Law - One Button Game</h1>

<p>Made by Lee Coronilia, Ed Gopez, Evan Lew, and Alex Xie for CMPM 170.<br>
The game was made with CrispGameLib. Maneuver the falling apples into the correct buckets as apples randomly fall out of the tree. The 
apples can fall in many paths, so you have to keep an eye on all the apples to get the best score you can.
