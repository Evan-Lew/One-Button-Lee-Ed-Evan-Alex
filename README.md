<h1>Bullseye - One Button Game</h1>

<p>Made by Evan Lew for CMPM 170.<br>
The game was made with CrispGameLib. The core gameplay mechanic is for the player to 
push the dart up in order to hit one of the targets once the player loses control to gravity. 
Everytime a target is hit the targets move to a random spot on the screen. The player can control 
the dart up until it touches the white line. The game is over when the player misses with their dart. 
A yellow target is 10 points, red is 5 points, and blue is 1 point. The white line disappears once the 
player gets past a minute of playtime.</p>
